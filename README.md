Predatory Journals take advantage of authors by asking them to publish for a fee without
providing peer-review or editing services. Because predatory publishers do not follow the
proper academic standards for publishing, they usually offer a quick turnaround on publishing
a manuscript. They are regarded as predatory because scholars are tricked into publishing
with them, although some authors may be aware that the journal is poor quality or even
fraudulent. In contrast, high quality academic journals take longer to publish articles because
they go through a proper peer review and copy editing process. We are implementing
Predatory Journal Detection using application software made using various Web
Technologies. This project aims at automating the predatory journal detecting process using
the parameters on which the journals are reviewed. Each Journal should be automatically
evaluated based on the evaluation criteria trained there should be a database for the journals
and evaluation criteria. The author when submit the journal should be evaluated on various
criteriaâ€™s automatically and detect whether the journal is Predatory or not.
