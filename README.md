Predatory Journals take advantage of authors by asking them to publish for a fee without
providing peer-review or editing services. Because predatory publishers do not follow the
proper academic standards for publishing, they usually offer a quick turnaround on publishing
a manuscript. They are regarded as predatory because scholars are tricked into publishing
with them, although some authors may be aware that the journal is poor quality or even
fraudulent. In contrast, high quality academic journals take longer to publish articles because
they go through a proper peer review and copy editing process. 

We implemented a model for Predatory Journal Detection and integrate it in a website. This project aims at automating the predatory journal detecting process using the parameters on which the journals are reviewed.
